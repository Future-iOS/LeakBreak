# Download Future Default iOS Apps with LeakBreak

</div>

Leakbreak happens when Apple's new iOS updates, like iOS 18 and higher, are released to the public before the company officially announces or distributes them. This unauthorized sharing gives people early access to features and improvements that Apple is still working on. It's similar to "jailbreaking," which involves bypassing the security and restrictions that Apple builds into the iOS operating system. Both Leakbreak and jailbreaking allow users to explore and use their devices in ways that Apple doesn't normally permit. While these practices can offer more freedom and customization.
